    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>These terms govern your use of Daily ("the app", "we", "our"), an AI-powered day planner available at getdaily.live. By using the app, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Daily generates personalized day plans and itineraries using artificial intelligence. Plans are suggestions only — we do not guarantee the accuracy, availability, or quality of any venue, event, price, or activity mentioned.</p>

    <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You sign in using Google OAuth. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account.</li>
      <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the app.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily offers free and paid (Pro) tiers. Free accounts are limited to 3 plans per month.</li>
      <li>Pro subscriptions are billed monthly ($19/month) or yearly ($99/year) through Stripe.</li>
      <li>You can cancel your subscription at any time through the app's profile page or Stripe customer portal. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
      <li>We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods. If you believe you were charged in error, contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Plans are generated by AI and may contain inaccuracies, outdated information, or errors. Always verify important details (hours, prices, availability) before visiting a venue.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on AI-generated recommendations.</li>
      <li>Generated content is for personal use. You may share your plans but may not resell or commercially redistribute them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Google Calendar Integration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The app can add itinerary events to your Google Calendar. This requires granting calendar access when signing in.</li>
      <li>We only create events — we do not read, modify, or delete your existing calendar data.</li>
      <li>You can revoke calendar access at any time from your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account settings</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or abuse the API.</li>
      <li>Circumvent usage limits or subscription restrictions.</li>
      <li>Impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The app, its design, code, and branding are owned by us. AI-generated plan content is provided to you for personal use under a non-exclusive license.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to reliance on AI-generated recommendations.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Material changes will be communicated via the app or email.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
